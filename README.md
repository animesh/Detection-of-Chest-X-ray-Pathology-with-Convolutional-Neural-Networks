# Capstone: Chest X-ray Classifier using the NIH Chest X-ray Dataset made public fall/winer of 2017

## sample X-rays

## Current Progress:
Framing the problem as one that is solvable with binary classification. Currently the model classifies Anterior-Posterior and Posterior-Anterior Chest X-rays as 'No Findings' or Abnormal with Findings. 

Currently testing on CNN architecture consisting of 3 convolutional Layers, Dense layer, dropout layer, Dense layer. A very simple topology that my laptop with 16gb and a nvidea 940mx can handle.
